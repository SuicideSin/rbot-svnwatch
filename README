README

These tools were built back in 2005 for the PDX.rb IRC channel so that our
bot could post messages in #pdxruby each time someone would commit to one
of our Subversion repositories.

As an experiment, we decided to use Drb as the protocal for sending commit
meesages from Subversion to our IRC channel.

Usage

The post-commit file should be placed in your Subversion repository's hooks
directory.

The svnwatch.rb file should be placed in the rbot plugins/ directroy. When
you load rbot it will scan the directory and load this plugin. DRb will
automatically start up.
